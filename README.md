# weather_module

This program suggests recipes based on the season (summer/winter/monsoon)
For now, it only works for the summer season since the dataset for winter and monsoon aren't cleaned and ready yet.

This module will output top N recipes that are best to be prepared right now (according to the season).  

You may open the file 'Untitled-2' to get the final list of those recipes.
